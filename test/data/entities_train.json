    "text": "Mole rat wonder meat ( Fallout 3 ) Mole rat wonder meat is a craftable food item in \" Fallout 3 \" which can be made with two simple ingredients and access to the Wonder meat maker , located within the Jury Street tunnels . Background . The wonder meat can be made very simply by taking a piece of Mole rat meat and a tube of wonderglue to Ryan ' s wonder meat maker and activating it , combining the two to create one piece of the wonder meat . They are not hard to find as these items are strewn all over the laboratory . Characteristics . The wonder meat itself is 4 times more effective at HP regeneration than normal mole rat meat , bringing it up to 20 , while not altering the rad value whatsoever . In combination with the food sanitizer , this boosts the healing factor to 24 , on par with mirelurk meat , but without incurring the usual danger , difficulty , and general rarity of finding and killing the creatures . While the sanitizer is active , wonder meat is nearly on par with human flesh in terms of HP gain , and with far fewer rads .",
