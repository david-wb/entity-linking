    "text": "Chubbit The Chubbits were a species of bipedal , sentient reptiles indigenous to the desert world of Aridus in the Expansion Region . The average Chubbit stood shorter than a fully grown Human . Their skin was green or yellow , although some featured red or black spots . Their nervous system was easily crippled by ultra - strong frequency waves . On their dry homeworld , the Chubbits made use of indigenous technology such as wind - runner s , wheeled vehicles that were propelled by large sails . The Chubbits suffered after the rise of the Galactic Empire . In 19 BBY , numerous Chubbits were held as slaves by gangs on the planet Telerath and one of its moons . The fugitive Jedi Dass Jennir freed many of these Chubbits . Meanwhile , Imperial troops on Aridus found valuable natural resources there . However , when mining outfits attempted to extract these raw materials , Aridus ' s ionized atmosphere rendered their equipment inoperable . The Empire thus approved construction of the Iron Tower , a massive power transformer and signal amplifier to rectify the technological problems ; the Empire paid little heed when the tower ' s strong frequency waves crippled the nervous systems and even killed many of the planet ' s natives . The Chubbits responded by waging a guerrilla war on the Empire , armed with blasters , repulsor tanks , and crawler tanks supplied by sympathetic Yutrane - Trackata workers and the Alliance to Restore the Republic . Other offworlders provided support as well , including the Human Wrenga Jixton and a man who claimed to be the Human Jedi Master Obi - Wan Kenobi . In 0 ABY , the Kenobi impersonator destroyed the Iron Tower when the devotion shown him by the Chubbits and the Rebel Alliance hero Luke Skywalker prompted him to thwart a ploy by the Sith Lord Darth Vader to lure Skywalker into a trap at the Iron Tower . In the aftermath of the structure ' s fall , Jixton swore his services to Vader in exchange for an Imperial retreat from the Chubbit homeworld , and in 4 ABY , the New Republic sought an alliance with the species . The Yuuzhan Vong later conquered Aridus around 27 ABY during their invasion of the galaxy . Biology and appearance . A species of small reptiles \u2014 the average adult came up to a typical Human ' s waist \u2014 Chubbits were sentient lizard s . The Chubbit body followed a roughly humanoid plan , with a head , torso , two arms , and two legs . Each hand featured either five or four digits , including an opposable thumb , while their feet gave the species a digitigrade gait on wide , splayed toes . While some Chubbits sported a stocky build , others had a lanky frame . Skin coloration varied from light green to yellow , with the top of the head often sporting mottling of another color , such as red or black . Each Chubbit possessed a broad , flat head that tapered to a blunt snout in the front . Two nostrils pierced the top surface of the muzzle , and a wide mouth split its anterior surface . This toothless maw housed a pointed , green tongue and pink gums . The two Chubbit eyes were placed far apart on either side of the head . They were colored either white , green , or red and their pupils could appear as either small circles or vertical slits . With some Chubbits , a red tympanic membrane was visible directly behind each eye . While many Chubbits were bald , others sported a tuft of hair at the back of the head , tresses that came in shades of black , red , blond , or white . The Chubbit anatomy included a nervous system that was susceptible to powerful technological emanations of the sort given off by the Iron Tower , a structure built by the Galactic Empire on the Chubbits ' homeworld of Aridus . The effects of these invisible forces crippled the Chubbit neurological system and eventually proved fatal for many individuals . Society and culture . The Chubbits inhabited the deserts of the planet Aridus , a remote world considered a backwater by the rest of the galaxy . Members of the species traveled the sands on domesticated long - necked lizards known as droffi steed s , which Chubbit riders controlled via saddles , stirrups , and bridles . Others used wind - runner s , large , ground vehicles that rolled about on wheels and were propelled by winds caught in their large sails . By 0 ABY , the Chubbits were at ease with advanced weaponry , including blaster rifles and proton grenade s , although these arms had to be smuggled onto their world . On Aridus , Chubbits often wore loose - fitting clothing , which included cloaks , cowls , baggy trousers , headwrap s , and boots . Others wore clothing typical of spacefaring species , including long - sleeved shirts , trousers , vests , and boots . Offworld Chubbit regalia was similar , with the addition of loose tunics , belts , short pants , and slippers . Chubbits who grew out their hair often bound it into a topknot . Chubbits could be suspicious of outsiders , but they were intensely loyal to those who earned their trust . Indeed , their appreciation for those who helped them could border on adoration . The Chubbit language was known as Chubbini . The tongue was characterized by the widespread use of \" / S / \" and \" / Z / \" sounds . History . Early history and Imperial occupation . The Chubbits were native to Aridus , a world of deserts and lava flows in the Flarestar system . The system was first reached by galactic explorers during the Great Manifest Period ; it had become part of the known galaxy by 15 , 000 BBY . The Chubbit homeworld eventually became part of the Narvath sector of the Expansion Region , and it was reachable via the Gamor Run hyperlane . From 1004 to 1000 BBY , as the New Sith Wars raged , the Chubbit home planet was located in territory controlled by the Galactic Republic . Centuries later , during the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems , Aridus was again allied with the Republic . The Republic ' s fall and resurrection as the Galactic Empire in 19 BBY brought Aridus to newfound prominence . The Chubbits could only stand by idly as the Empire scouted out valuable mineral resources on Aridus and then sent teams of miners to exploit them . When the offworlders discovered that their equipment \u2014 everything from mole miners to comlinks \u2014 was useless on the world due to the planet ' s ionized atmosphere , they obtained Imperial approval to construct an enormous structure , dubbed the Iron Tower , to act as a signal amplifier , power transformer and power source for Imperial hovertrain s , which transported the ore . Mining started back up , and the Chubbits discovered that the Iron Tower ' s emissions had a devastating effect on their nervous systems ; the neurological effects were so critical that many Chubbits even died . Rather than remain passive victims , the Chubbits formed a resistance movement to fight the Empire and drive it from Aridus . They struck a deal with the Alliance to Restore the Republic , which clandestinely smuggled weapons and munitions to the Chubbit freedom fighters . Some of the board members of the Aridus - based company Yutrane - Trackata secretly supported the Chubbit resistance after taking clandestine payments from the Alliance ; while the company made mining gear specifically for Imperial operations on Aridus , it provided T2 - B repulsor tanks and other mat\u00e9riel to the Chubbit freedom fighters by turning a blind when Chubbit forces raided its factories . Other outsiders supported the Chubbit cause as well ; for instance , the Human smuggler Wrenga Jixton , hiding out on Aridus , befriended the natives . The Iron Tower . In 0 ABY , the Chubbit resistance provided a convenient cover story for a ruse by the Sith Lord Darth Vader to trap Luke Skywalker , the young Human who had destroyed the Empire ' s Death Star battlestation in the Battle of Yavin . Vader had an actor surgically altered to resemble Obi - Wan Kenobi , Skywalker ' s deceased Jedi Master . The actor then joined the Chubbit resistance and ingratiated himself with the reptilians . The Chubbits accepted the fake Kenobi as the genuine article , and his exploits with them earned their awe and admiration . When Imperial stormtroopers broke up a Rebel arms deal with the Chubbits , Vader ' s gambit escalated ; the actor stepped in , apparently to let the Rebel gunrunner escape . In reality , the man ' s escape enabled him to flee back to the Rebel base on the moon Yavin 4 and to tell Skywalker about his encounter with \" Ben Kenobi . \" Skywalker took the bait and traveled to Aridus . As a band of Chubbit resistance fighters attempted to assault an Imperial hovertrain , Skywalker and his protocol droid , C - 3PO , joined them and threw bags full of proton charges at the target , causing it to crash . Skywalker was injured in the attack , so the Chubbits and the Kenobi impersonator tended to his wounds . The fake Kenobi put Skywalker aboard a Chubbit wind - runner for his safety and then led the Chubbits in a raid on an Imperial outpost \u2014 another calculated fraud to gain Skywalker ' s trust . When Skywalker and his droid rejoined the Chubbit resistance fighters , the actor insisted that the time had come to target the Iron Tower \u2014 a task he and Skywalker would accomplish alone . To that end , he ordered the Chubbits to bring C - 3PO back to Skywalker ' s starship lest the droid detect the technological fakery that enabled the actor to approximate the real Kenobi ' s Force powers . The gambit was designed to bring Skywalker to Vader , who was waiting in the Iron Tower , but the awe shown Kenobi by both Skywalker and the Chubbits caused the actor misgivings about the plan . The Chubbits ignored the actor ' s orders to stay behind to instead secure an elevated position and attack the Imperial forces at the tower to provide cover for the two infiltrators . However , the Chubbits failed to spot an incoming Imperial landspeeder headed for their location . Although the actor urged Skywalker to hurry into the tower , the Rebel ' s insistence on saving the Chubbits broke the actor ' s resolve ; since the real Kenobi would help the small reptiles , he disabled the speeder and saved the freedom fighters . During the subsequent mission within the Iron Tower , the actor ' s betrayal of Vader was complete : to help the Chubbits , he pulled a control lever and disabled the tower ' s systems . The decision cost the actor his life . Later history . The ensuing explosion knocked Vader unconscious from his perch within the tower . Wrenga Jixton found the Sith Lord ' s body and brought him aboard a starship that enabled Vader to escape . Jixton then used the leverage his act earned him to strike a deal with the Dark Lord : the Empire would abandon its operations on Aridus in exchange for Jixton ' s services in the future . Vader agreed , with the caveat that if Jixton ever failed to live up to his end of the bargain , Vader would rain death upon the desert world . The Chubbits survived Vader ' s threat ; in 4 ABY , months after the Dark Lord died and the Galactic Empire fragmented , the Chubbits received a diplomatic delegation from the Empire ' s successor as galactic hegemon , the New Republic . That government sought to enter an alliance with the Chubbits so that the New Republic could protect the species from the remnants of the Empire . The Human diplomat Leia Organa , daughter of the deceased Vader , led the delegation , fully aware that the Chubbits were still wary of offworlders due to the turmoil they had experienced under Imperial rule . Vader ' s other offspring , Luke Skywalker , also accompanied the expedition , and during initial talks , Organa learned that many of the Chubbits still fondly remembered Skywalker ' s exploits on Aridus . Nevertheless , the New Republic Jedi left the delegation to seek out more information about his father on the planet Tatooine . The Flarestar system had between one and ten million sentient inhabitants circa 25 ABY . By 26 ABY , the planet had fallen under the control of the Yuuzhan Vong during their invasion of the galaxy ; it remained so in 27 ABY . By 137 ABY , Aridus fell within territory controlled by the Sith Lord Darth Krayt as part of his Galactic Empire . Chubbits in the galaxy . Several years before 19 BBY , a war was fought on a desert planet over possession of a legendary artifact known as the Jebble Box . Chubbits fought in the war using blaster rifles , and some perished in the conflict . By 19 BBY , several Chubbits toiled as slaves on the archipelago of Noua on the planet Telerath in the Inner Rim . The Chubbits were held captive by rival gangs , including a band of Chagrian slavers and a group of T ' surri spice runners . While the Chagrians used their Chubbit captives to act as retainers and carry their swords , the T ' surri forced them to perform hard labor such as lifting and carrying goods . The Human Jedi Knight Dass Jennir discovered the plight of Telerath ' s Chubbit slaves when he fled to the world to escape Imperial persecution after the declaration of Order 66 , making the Jedi enemies of the Empire . He was hired by the Human woman Ember Chankeli to take out the slavers , but she was secretly allied with the spice - runners , who wanted complete control of the Noua underworld . During Jennir ' s first encounter with the Chagrian slavers , he feigned interest in joining them . When Jennir met the gang ' s leader , the Chagrian Mors Demanna , a Chubbit slave carried Demanna ' s sword ; another Chubbit later ran to the aid of the Human fisherman Dado when Demanna chopped off the boy ' s hand for daring to think he could join the gang . When Jennir began to suspect that the spice - runners kept slaves as well , he infiltrated one of their camps on Telerath ' s second moon , where he found large numbers of Chubbits and Nosaurians forced into hard labor . The Jedi wreaked havoc on the gang ' s spice refineries at the base , making the destruction seem like a gang attack . The Chubbit and Nosaurian captives fled in the slavers ' ships upon Jennir ' s urging . Jennir later returned to Demanna ' s slaver gang and asked to join ; the same Chubbit retainer took his sword from him before his meeting with Musori , the gang leader . However , the Musori gang discovered Jennir ' s machinations and beat him severely . Meanwhile , Ken - Kiba ' s gang took the offensive and captured and killed all of Musori ' s gang but Demanna himself . When Ken - Kiba ' s T ' surri gangmembers herded various townspeople and the prostitutes who worked for Chankeli into Chankeli ' s brothel ; there enslaved Chubbits continued to serve their T ' surri masters . Jennir infiltrated the establishment , killed the T ' surri guards , and freed the inmates , including the Chubbits , telling them to flee the town . Behind the scenes . Writer Archie Goodwin and artist Al Williamson created the Chubbits for \" The Return of Ben Kenobi , \" a storyline for their weekly \" Star Wars \" comic strip ; the Kenobi story was distributed to newspapers by the Los Angeles Times Syndicate from May 17 to July 5 , 1982 . In 1993 , Dark Horse Comics colorized , reformatted , and reprinted the strips in comic book form as part of its \" Classic Star Wars \" series . The colors , provided by Steve Buccellato , revealed the skin pigmentation of the Chubbits , a detail not present in the original newspapers strips . Williamson ' s Chubbits closely resemble a character named Gribbet , who plays a prominent role in another Goodwin \u2013 Williamson serialized story , \" The Bounty Hunter of Ord Mantell \" , syndicated from February 9 to April 19 , 1981 . However , a poster released with the magazine \" Star Wars Galaxy Magazine 6 \" in 1996 identifies Gribbet as a member of the Rybet species . Author Ryder Windham borrowed elements from Goodwin and Williamson ' s tale for two of his own \" Star Wars \" stories : the comic book \" Shadow Stalker \" , first published in 1997 , and the young adult novel \" \" , first published in 2009 . In the former , Windham brought in the Human smuggler Wrenga Jixton , first introduced in the 1996 comic \" Shadows of the Empire 2 \" , written by John Wagner , and explained the fate of the Chubbit ' s home planet , Aridus , after the events of Goodwin and Williamson ' s story . In \" The Life of Luke Skywalker \" , Windham tied up more loose ends from the comic strip story by framing the bulk of the book \u2014 a biography of Luke Skywalker \u2014 as a diplomatic visit from the newly formed New Republic to the Chubbits . Nevertheless , the book does not reveal the outcome of the diplomatic talks . In 2009 , artist Douglas Wheatley designed a more detailed visual depiction of the species when he included Chubbit characters in the \" \" comic book for Dark Horse Comics . His version of the species mostly resembles Williamson ' s , but he added more detailed features , such as wrinkled skin around the lips , more elaborate mottling on the head , skin folds around the eyes , and tympanic membranes behind each eye . \" \" features two Chubbits fighting in a war over the Jebble Box . The characters appear in a flashback , and the world is not named ; however , its depiction is consistent with that of Aridus , the Chubbit homeworld . The 2008 reference work \" The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia \" mentions the Chubbits in several entries , but it does not capitalize the word \" chubbit \" in the main entry for the species . However , the entries for the planet Aridus and the Iron Tower do capitalize the species ' name .",

    "title": "Crait",
    "text": "Crait Crait was a small salty mineral planet located in a remote sector of the galaxy ' s Outer Rim Territories . Covered with a layer of white salt over its red soil , the planet once hosted a Rebel Alliance outpost during their early rebellion against the Galactic Empire . Many years later , the uninhabited planet became a haven for Leia Organa ' s Resistance , which resulted in a battle between the Resistance and the First Order on the planet ' s surface . Description . Crait was a small , desolate , and uninhabited planet located in a remote star system of the same name . The planet was rich in mineral s and orbit ed one star . A thick crust of white - colored salt covered nearly the entire planet surface , with red - colored rhodocrosite base beneath . Dominated by large salt flats , the planet also featured mountain s , canyons , and deeply sunken water ways \u2014 which were possibly home to aquatic creatures . The planet had a Type 1 atmosphere \u2014 it was breathable to oxygen - breathers , such as human s . The white salt - covered surface reflected the planet ' s sunlight , which would be blinding at midday . The sodium - containing salt also made the planet surface slippery , hard to travel ; with gusts of wind sending up flumes of white salt . The planet was also inhabited by Vulptices , fox - like creatures with white , crystal line fur that lived within the burrows and tunnels beneath the surface of Crait . History . Imperial Era . During the reign of the Galactic Empire , the early rebel movement \u2014 a loose network of rebel cells led in secret by Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan \u2014 established a secret outpost on the northern continent of the planet Crait . In the year 3 BBY , one of these rebel groups attacked Calderos Station , a large Imperial facility used as a deep - space waypoint , to weaken Imperial control and cover rebel shipment tracks to Crait . Although the rebels presumed that all data about Calderos Station was erased , Bail ' s adopted daughter , Prince ss Leia Organa , managed to find some old space traffic data which linked Crait and Calderos Station . To discover the identity of the attacker , Leia Organa and her guard Lieutenant Ress Batten traveled to Crait aboard the \" Polestar \" . After the ship landed on the planet surface , Leia was detained by rebel soldier s as she refused their proposal to leave Crait immediately . Upon being taken to the base , Leia found out that it was her father who was in charge of this facility , and her parent s were secretly organizing a rebel movement against the Empire . The rebel movement eventually turned into a more organized Rebel Alliance , and the Crait outpost was abandoned some time before the Battle of Scarif in 0 BBY , which marked the outbreak of the Galactic Civil War . Later in the Galactic Civil War , Rebel heroes Leia , Han Solo , and Luke Skywalker led the Rebellion to Crait while searching for a location for a new Rebel base . During the search , they encountered Trusk Berinato , a male individual who employed some mining droid s to work in the Mines of Crait .

          "text": "Mission to Crait During the Galactic Civil War , the Alliance to Restore the Republic sent Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa on a mission to the mineral planet Crait to scout it as a possible rebel base . Prelude . Following the destruction of the Death Star , the Rebel Alliance were on the run from the Galactic Empire and searched for new location for their base . Prince ss Leia Organa made it her personal mission to find a location for the Alliance with help from Luke Skywalker and Han Solo . After the Empire ' s attack on the Alliance Fleet , they retreated to Baraan - Fa . There , Organa spoke with Chancellor Mon Mothma about using Crait as a location for their new base . It had been abandoned by the Nupayuni Mining Consortium decades ago . However , Mothma did not like the idea of using a \" dead \" planet . Despite that fact , Organa told her that Trusk Berinato assured her father that Crait could be a potential location for a base . Despite her concerns , Mothma decided to let Organa take a survey team to Crait . The Mission . Organa , with Captain s Skywalker , Solo , Chewbacca and Wedge Antilles traveled to Crait with the \" Millennium Falcon \" and a GR - 75 medium transport loaded with equipment . Upon their landing , they were then met by Berinato and his mining droid s . Organa and the survey team went with Berinato to look at the mines using their V - 4X - D ski speeder s . During this time , Solo became suspicious of Berinato . Skywalker , along with Antilles then started to dig trenches outside the mine despite difficulty with several worm s . But during a trip with their speeder s , Antilles and Skywalker spotted a group of flash - dried corpses . Familiar with dead in similar conditions , Skywalker realized quickly that it was due to a salt storm , one so big and strong that would strand them on Crait for years . However , Organa told Berinato that they would not be staying Crait for long . Organa knew that he had signaled the Empire , which sent SCAR Squadron to their location . Despite this betrayal , Organa was willing to let Berinato help them escape , but he refused . Thus Organa , Skywalker , Solo , and Chewbacca boarded their ski speeders to attack SCAR Squadron head on while the first waves of the storm arrived . The two forces fought each other . SCAR Squadron ' s commander , Sergeant Kreel then drew his lightsaber and fought Skywalker . After the fight with the other SCAR troopers , Solo , Chewbacca and Organa returned to the \" Falcon \" . However , they were then confronted by Berinato and his droid s who refused to let them leave . Skywalker continued to fight Kreel until Skywalker destroyed his lightsaber . With help from Antilles , SCAR squadron was forced to limp away and retreat . Berinato then shot Solo to force her to come with him . However , Organa was able to use Solo ' s blaster to shoot Berinato ' s blaster out of his hand . Skywalker , and the rest of the survey team arrived and left Crait aboard the \" Falcon \" . Aftermath . Aboard the \" Falcon \" , Organa told Mothma that Crait was not ideal for base . Organa ' s survey team was also forced to leave several Spiezoc v - 120 , v - 232 artillery emplacement s , the ski speeders and an armory filled with blaster rifles and pistols . The Rebel Alliance did eventually build a Base on Hoth . Years after the Galactic Civil War , Crait had fallen off modern starcharts . In 34 ABY , Organa , now a General of the Resistance , led the surviving members to Crait ' s outpost when they were pursued by the First Order ' s forces . There , the Resistance used the abandoned Rebel Alliance gear against the First Order until the \" Falcon \" rescued the survivors and escaped ."

    "title": "Jedi Coalition",
    "text": "Jedi Coalition The Jedi Coalition was a coalition government , between both the New Jedi Order and the Alliance - in - exile , as well as the Maw Irregular Fleet , the Mandalorians and the Imperial Remnant , formed by Luke Skywalker , after the Battle of Kashyyyk , in response to Darth Caedus ' rule of the Galactic Alliance . The Coalition ' s primary objective was to remove Caedus from power in order to peacefully end the Second Galactic Civil War . History . Withdrawal at Kuat . The Battle of Kuat had been going on for nearly a week ; Darth Caedus ' plan to finally win the war was to have the Jedi in their StealthX starfighters launch a shadow bomb run on the Confederation Fleet and destroy it . While talking with his fellow Jedi , Luke Skywalker tried to come up with a plan of action for the Jedi to take . There was nothing to arrest Jacen Solo for , and Skywalker didn ' t want to support the Confederation . However , Skywalker knew that the Jedi couldn ' t allow Solo to push them any further \u2014 something needed to be done ; Skywalker asked the Jedi when that line was crossed , but the rest of the Jedi stated that the line wasn ' t crossed until he said so . Then , Cilghal arrived and told Skywalker that Chief of State Cal Omas had been killed and that it was Ben Skywalker who did it . Luke immediately confronted Jacen and informed him that the Jedi would no longer support him . After Jacen threatened to kill the Jedi he held hostage on Ossus , Luke returned to his StealthX and left . It seemed , to Caedus , that the Jedi ' s withdrawal from the Alliance was not official , and was ready to use them to end the war . After the Jedi launched , he reached out to them , urging them to attack , but , they responded with waves of anger , and left the system . Caedus realized that the Jedi had deserted him , and ordered that the Jedi Temple on Coruscant be occupied and the Jedi on Ossus to be killed . Even though the Alliance eventually won at Kuat , the battle didn ' t have the intended impact on the Confederation , and both sides suffered heavy casualties . The Battle of Kashyyyk . After Kuat , Skywalker led the Council Masters to Kashyyyk so they could address the Rock Council . He informed them that the assassination of Cal Omas was arranged by Solo , and requested that the Wookiees join their Coalition against him . After being informed by Ben that the Jedi were on Kashyyyk , Caedus departed for Kashyyyk to give the Wookiees an opportunity to turn over the Jedi , even though he knew they would refuse . When his fleet arrived , a squadron of Owools approached and heard his demands . Caedus ' s true intentions , however , were to make the Confederation abort their military campaign towards Coruscant . After the Wookiees lied about harboring the Jedi , Caedus had justification for attacking the planet , which would attract the Confederation away from the core , and force them to help the Wookiees . He began an Orbital bombardment of the planet . The Owools led by Lowbacca immediately launched a Jedi shadow bomb on the \" Anakin Solo \" \u2019 s bridge . At the same time , Ben Skywalker tried to kill Caedus . Both Lowbacca and Ben had failed to kill him and Caedus immobilized Ben with Force lightning and put him in the Embrace of Pain , hoping to turn him to the dark side . On Kashyyyk , Han and Leia Organa Solo left for Hapes to gain the support of Queen Mother Tenel Ka Djo . Meanwhile , Skywalker led a wing of StealthXs in an assault on the \" Anakin Solo \" s long - range turbolaser batteries that were firing on the planet . The Wookiee fleet was still organizing , which left the Jedi as the planet ' s only defenders . Caedus flew out in his own StealthX and engaged his sister , Jaina , and his uncle . After being shot down by friendly fire , Skywalker faked his own death and landed on the \" Anakin Solo \" . After disabling the long - range turbolasers , he engaged Caedus in a fierce duel . The fight between Grand Master and Dark Lord of the Sith was extremely vicious , and the upper hand shifted back and forth until the younger Skywalker escaped the Embrace , came to the aid of his father , and stabbed Caedus with a vibroblade . Since Skywalker believed that if his son killed Caedus , the latter would fall to the dark side ; thus , he took Ben and departed . Parley on the \" Dragon Queen \" . After the duel , Tenel Ka Djo arrived with her forces , and attacked Caedus ' fleet , after he denied her offer of surrender . With an overwhelming amount of enemies attacking , it seemed that the Fifth Fleet would be destroyed . But the arrival of Alema Rar and her Sith Meditation Sphere combined with Caedus ' s own Sith Battle Meditation gave him the power to push through the Bothan forces and escape . Afterwards , the Confederation and Jedi leaders met on the \" Dragon Queen \" to discuss the stance of the Jedi , the Wookiees , and the Hapans in the war . The Jedi stated that they would not side with the Confederation , but would form their own faction dedicated to removing Solo from power , and , after achieving their goal , would rejoin the Galactic Alliance . Both the Hapans and Wookiees decided to side with the Jedi . The Jedi Coalition was officially formed , and agreed not interfere with the Confederation , or their plans against Solo . Ambush in the Undercity . After Kashyyyk , Luke took Ben as his apprentice and set up a temporary base for the Jedi Coalition on Endor . Knowing that action needed to be taken against Jacen , he charged Kyp Durron with planning a mission . Kyp formed a plan to capture Caedus outside the Senate Building and escape in the undercity with their captive while a fake escape shuttle lead any security away . Kyp and Luke agreed that if they couldn \u2019 t capture Jacen they would kill him . After meeting Seha Dorvald , the team ' s guide through the undercity and a former spy for Jacen , he approved the plan . Kyp wanted Luke to lead the ambush , but Luke refused because he believed he would attack in hatred and appointed Kyle Katarn as the leader . The team was made up of Katarn , Valin Horn , Thann Mithric , Kolir Hu ' lya and Seha . They traveled to Coruscant and planned for Seha to plant a tracking device on Caedus ' s cloak so they could track his movements . The mission was only a partial success . Seha was able to plant the device on Caedus but at a price . Jacen was now a powerful Dark Lord of the Sith and emerged from the ambush victorious after decapitating Mithric and stabbing Kyle Katarn through the chest . Seha and Horn managed to drag Katarn to safety and escaped with the rest of the team . Destroying Centerpoint Station . During a visit from Tenel Ka Djo , Luke Skywalker offered to retrieve her daughter Allana from Jacen who was using her to keep the Hapans in the war . Luke planned to destroy Centerpoint Station , which he believed was too dangerous for any organization to control . The Jedi taskforce would infiltrate both Centerpoint Station and the \" Anakin Solo \" where Allana was being held . During the battle Jedi Master Kyp Durron and his team infiltrated Centerpoint disguised as GAG troopers while Luke , his son and Saba Sebatyne distracted Jacen as Han and Leia retrieved Allana . Wedge Antilles and the Rakehells defended the transports and shuttles containing the strike teams . The Skywalkers would board the \" Anakin Solo \" using General Tycho Celchu ' s shuttle . The Jedi task force dropped out of hyperspace near Centerpoint Station . Rakehell Squadron moved toward the \" Anakin Solo \" shooting at the \" Reveille \" so the shuttle would be allowed to land in the Star Destroyer . As the shuttle landed inside the hangar , Tycho alerted GAG forces that Jedi were onboard . Caedus immediately felt the presences of the Jedi and sent YVH droids to stall them . Rakehell Squadron repeated their previous tactic with a false strike on \" Broadside \" which gave them authorization to land on Centerpoint . Aboard the transport was Doctor Toval Seyah and Kyp Durron who would disable and destroy Centerpoint . As Luke ' s team entered the \" Anakin Solo \" s bridge Caedus had his YVH droids engage them . Meanwhile , Han , Leia , and Iella crawled through secret shafts on the \" Anakin \" to get to Allana without Caedus knowing . They finally found Allana and headed towards the \" Millennium Falcon \" . During the fight on the bridge Darth Caedus saw his droids being destroyed so he used the Force to throw Saba into one of the pits which was on fire then slammed her into the port - side wall . The team was forced to retreat when Caedus left after sensing Allana being taken away . Luke warned Leia that Jacen was on his way and they headed towards the air lock . Luke , Ben , and Saba , being chased by Caedus , finally arrived and left the \" Anakin Solo \" with Allana . Meanwhile Doctor Seyah sabotaged Centerpoint Station which led to its destruction . Allies gained at Fondor . After the Jedi escaped with Allana , Darth Caedus demanded to know how the Jedi boarded the \" Anakin Solo . \" When Lieutenant Patra Tebut admitted that although she followed protocol it was her fault , the Dark Lord Force choked her to death in front of the entire bridge crew . This incident shocked the entire Galactic Alliance Navy and convinced Cha Niathal to begin communicating with Luke Skywalker in secret . Niathal gave Luke details on the upcoming invasion of Fondor , revealing to Luke that his nephew was a Sith Lord and that he had enlisted the Imperial Remnant for the upcoming battle . Luke Skywalker warned the Fondorian s of the space mines to be placed around the planet which led to the minelayer crew being killed . This greatly affected the battle against the Alliance forces as the mines could have taken out many ships quickly and reduced Alliance casualties . The Jedi did not directly fight in the battle ; they only protected the unarmed civilians working in the orbital yards and hid the Fondorian navy until they ambushed the Alliance / Imperial fleet . After the Fondorians surrendered , the battle still ended up being a major victory for the Coalition after Caedus refused to accept the surrender and continued to bombard Fondor . Admiral Niathal attempted to relieve Caedus of his rank and the Galactic Alliance split into two . One side was the official GA that supported Darth Caedus which included a large majority of the Galactic Alliance Defense Force . The other was Niathal ' s Alliance - in - exile which was made up of defectors from the Third and Fouth fleets . They joined the Coalition along with the Maw Irregular Fleet and the Mandalorians under Boba Fett . Luke Skywalker negotiated with the president of Fondor to use the planet as the Coalition ' s base of operations , making a place for all enemies of Darth Caedus to rally . Reunion . The Coalition ended when the Sword of the Jedi faced off against , and killed , her brother , the Dark Lord of the Sith , bringing the war to an end . Everyone returned to their respective factions ; splitting the Jedi Coalition back into the Galactic Alliance and the New Jedi Order once again .

The IDW Publishing series , of which the first issue came out on July 12 , 2017 on StarWars . com and will be released physically as a part of promotion , while the series will officially start on September 6 , features stories from the entirety of \" Star Wars \" and is intended for all ages . On January 3 , 2018 , IDW published the of a on the \" \" animated micro - series . The trade paperback of the German comics published by Panini will be titled . Development . In early 2016 , IDW Publishing presented the idea for a comic book series aimed at younger audiences to Lucasfilm . Artists like Derek Charm and George Caltsoudas were commissioned by IDW to create art for their pitch . The series was announced on April 14 , 2017 at Celebration Orlando during the publishing panel as a new IDW ongoing comic book series that would tell stories from across the saga . A day later , in an interview with The Star Wars Show , IDW Publishing chief creative officer Chris Ryall talked more about the series . He revealed the fact that the book will have rotating creative teams and that each issue will feature a lead story about popular characters from the films and back - up stories with lesser known or fan - favorite characters , including the ones from the TV series , hosted by Maz Kanata as the narrator , though other characters , such as C - 3PO were considered too . Ryall also said that some of the back - up stories will not be entirely canon . On June 6 , 2017 , Ryall conducted an interview with the podcast \" Comics with Kenobi \" , where he spoke about the series . He said that a lot of people messaged him soon after the announcement about them wanting to do this their entire life . This allowed Ryall to make a large creative pool , from which he could pull from in the future . It was explained that while Marvel Comics still has the \" Star Wars \" comics license , they don ' t have any books aimed at beginner readers , that ' s where \" Star Wars Adventures \" would come in . Ryall also suggested that the usage of Maz Kanata as the back - up story storyteller might have been dropped by this point . Then , on June 14 , 2017 , IDW released their upcoming comics catalogue , which included the release information on the first and second issue of the series , excluding the SDCC Ashcan . Lead stories in both issues would be about Rey ' s adventures on Jakku prior to \" \" , while issue 2 particularly would star Unkar Plutt . Issue 1 ' s back - up story would be a \" comical tale of clone catastrophe , \" though the story would ultimately be about Obi - Wan Kenobi . Chad Thomas did a few try - out character designs , including Han Solo , Chewbacca , Yoda and Kylo Ren , around this time to get to work on the series . It would eventually be announced that he would be doing the art for the back - up story of \" Star Wars Adventures 6 \" . The character of Maz Kanata as the storyteller of the stories featured in the back - ups of each comic was eventually replaced by the adventurer Emil Graf , a new character created for the series . These stories are titled \" Tales from Wild Space \" , after \" \" , a series of novels by Cavan Scott , which feature characters Milo Graf and Lina Graf .

          "title": "Mutiny on the Far Orbit",
          "text": "Mutiny on the Far Orbit In 0 ABY , a mutiny occurred on the Imperial EF76 Nebulon - B escort frigate \" Far Orbit \" while the vessel was in the Outer Rim Territories of the galaxy . After months of planning , mutineers led by Commander Dhas Fenoep Vedij , the second - in - command of the frigate , seized the \" Far Orbit \" from Captain Vocis Kenit and his troopers after the mutineers overwhelmed the Imperial loyalists . Under Vedij , the \" Far Orbit \" then became a privateer frigate for the Alliance to Restore the Republic shortly after the Imperial loyalists were kicked off the ship via escape pods and the \" Far Orbit \" shuttles . Prelude . In the year 0 ABY , during the Galactic Civil War between the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic , the Imperial Navy ' s EF76 Nebulon - B escort frigate \" Far Orbit \" was under the helm of Captain Vocis Kenit , with his second - in - command being Commander Dhas Fenoep Vedij . However , Kenit was not particularly liked by the crew of the \" Far Orbit \" , as he was a bully and martinet in personality , and maintained discipline with the ship ' s security , which consisted of a platoon of stormtroopers and a platoon of Imperial Navy trooper s . Vedij , who also disliked Kenit , began planning the start of a mutiny after his brother , Elon Vedij , was transferred to the \" Far Orbit \" , making the pair suspect that the two of them would soon be disposed of by the Empire . That was because their parents had been killed two days prior to Elon Vedij ' s transfer to the frigate in an accident that Dhas Vedij believed was designed to silence his father , who was a vocal opponent of the Empire . Vedij then continued to plan and plot for months . Around that time , the \" Far Orbit \" was tracking a group of pirates known as the Silent Blades in the Outer Rim Territories for several weeks and finally managed to corner them in an asteroid belt . In an attempt to break the standoff that followed , Kenit had the \" Far Orbit \" TIE Series starfighter complement attack the pirates in the asteroid belt , which ended with an Imperial victory but resulted in the loss of all the Imperial pilots and their fighters , including Elon Vedij . After the death of his brother , Dhas Vedij gained the trust and support of the crew for the mutiny and convinced most of the Imperial Navy troopers to either help with the mutiny or stay in their quarters during . Following news of the Empire ' s destruction of the planet Alderaan reaching the \" Far Orbit \" , an Alderaanian shiphand was beaten by Kenit ' s men for suspected treason . Vedij circulated a rumor that the shiphand was being beaten for being Alderaanian and used the outrage and the men ' s support of the Commander to start the mutiny . The mutiny . As the mutiny commenced , the Imperial stormtroopers were trapped by security bulkhead s after being distracted by a false report of a riot . The \" Far Orbit \" lone COMPNOR Observation officer was overcome , and , after Vedij announced the mutiny , around two - thirds of the entire crew joined him in the effort . Those who did not join him did not resist and were put with the captured stormtroopers . The mutiny then ended with the \" Far Orbit \" being controlled by Vedij and his forces . Aftermath . Once the \" Far Orbit \" was secure , Vedij and some of his men personally escorted Kenit and seven of the Captain ' s loyalists to the ship ' s escape pods at blasterpoint . Following the threats Kenit directed at Vedij , which revolved around Vedij being tortured and punished , Kenit and the seven others were put off the ship in escape pods . Likewise , the rest of Kenit ' s loyalists and stormtroopers were ejected in escape pods or in some of the frigate ' s shuttles . Vedij then informed the crew via the ship ' s comm unit that Kenit had been expelled from the ship , and that the \" Far Orbit \" would be traveling to the Core Worlds , as most people who participated in a mutiny tended to go toward the Outer Rim instead . Imperial forces later picked up Kenit ' s escape pod , and he was punished for failing in his command of the \" Far Orbit \" . Half of the \" Far Orbit \" remaining crew decided to jump ship rather than stay aboard , leaving the frigate crewed with just enough people to keep it running under the command of Vedij , who took the title of captain . After the mutiny , the \" Far Orbit \" had six months of remaining supplies and two remaining shuttles , though all the escape pods were jettisoned to put off the Imperials . The ship went on to become a privateer frigate for the Rebel Alliance and seized a convoy of freighters , Shipment 1037 , starting a string of successes for the \" Far Orbit \" as it continued as a privateering vessel . Behind the scenes . The mutiny was first mentioned in 1998 ' s \" The Far Orbit Project \" , by Timothy S . O ' Brien . The book was a supplement to West End Games ' s \" \" and had the same theme of the previous publication \" Pirates & Privateers \" , as it followed the privateering vessel \" Far Orbit \" . The mutiny starts off the story of the playable campaign ."

    "text": "ClanRing The ClanRing was a piece of jewelry rumored to have been created by the First Riileb , a mythical founding figure amongst the Riileb species native to the planet Riileb . The ClanRing would be held by the Riileb whom controlled Riileb society , the eldest female member of the motherclan , a group of Riileb supposedly descended from the First Riileb . The female would inherit it at the age of 30 in local years , which was the equivalent of 30 standard years . Political infighting and deceit was common amongst the motherclan and heirs would often be disposed of by other members who stood to inherit after them . Tere Metallo was one such heir and was sold into slavery by a jealous sister at the age of 25 . Behind the scenes . The ClanRing was first mentioned in the short story \" Rendezvous with Destiny \" written by Charlene Newcomb which was published in 1995 in the sixth issue of the \" Star Wars Adventure Journal \" series of roleplaying supplements for the West End Games roleplaying game , \" \" . It was then mentioned again in the article \" Alien Encounters \" by Brian Smithson in the thirteenth issue of the series published in 1997 . The article was then published again in a reduced form in \" Alien Encounters \" in 1998 , a collection of all the \" Alien Encounters \" articles compiled by Paul Sudlow .",

          "title": "Riileb ( planet )",
          "text": "Riileb ( planet ) Riileb was a planet in Hutt Space and the homeworld of the Riileb species . This planet was one of the few worlds within Hutt Space other than the Sakiyan worlds to maintain independence against Hutt influence . It was a hot and torrid world which supported a wide range of flora and fauna . Much of the planet was covered in oceans with islands being the only landforms . Geography . The planet was hot and muggy , making it uncomfortable by most species ' standards . However , this environment supported a vast array of organisms , ranging from microscopic bacteria to complex avians and mammals ; many species of its native insects were renowned for their uncomfortable bites . Water covered most of the world ; islands were the only significant land forms . Riileb cities were situated on these islands and consisted of labyrinthine twists and alleyways , holdovers from the mounds built by the species in ancient times . Society . The eldest female member of the motherclan , those Riileb whose ancestry supposedly stretched directly back to the species ' mythical forebear , ruled the world and its inhabitants through her possession of an artifact known as the ClanRing . This ruler passed the ring and her power on to her eldest female descendent when the daughter reached 30 local years ( roughly 21 standard years ) of age . Nevertheless , the succession was often marred by political intrigue and even assassinations . The world had access to all aspects of galactic technology . Offworld visitors were rare , although some traders chose to pick up cargoes of heklu , amphibious animals whose meat was en vogue in the Core Worlds . Due to its independence despite being located in the midst of Hutt Space , some offworlders chose to seek temporary haven on the world as they evaded the Hutts . History . A band of Nimbanese scouts were the first offworlders to visit Riileb . They were an advance team sent by their Hutt overlords on a mission to find more slaves for their masters and expand the bounds of Hutt Space . A series of skirmishes ensued on the world , pitting the Riileb against the forces of Velrugha the Hutt . Despite having only reached feudal levels of technology , the Riileb managed to repel the aggressors , and Velrugha eventually chose to leave the planet and search for less resistant prey . As a consequence of this incident , Riileb was left as one of the few independent islands within Hutt Space alongside the Sakiyan worlds ."

          "text": "Dominion ( Star Dreadnought ) The Dominion was a Star Dreadnought active by 12 ABY . Originally part of the forces of Imperial warlord Blitzer Harrsk , the \" Dominion \" was recovered by Imperial officer Gilad Pellaeon and used to strengthen the navy of the Imperial Remnant . Under the command of Admiral Teren Rogriss , the Super Star Destroyer participated in the Battle of Orinda against the New Republic . Five years later , the \" Dominion \" engaged New Republic forces in the Battle of Anx Minor , a major Imperial defeat . By 41 ABY , the \" Dominion \" was still operational . It served as the flagship of the Remnant ' s invasion force during the attack on the Roche asteroid field during the Second Galactic Civil War . When the Imperial fleet arrived at the asteroid field , Mandalorian leader Boba Fett \u2014 on hand to assist in the defense of the asteroid Nickel One \u2014 convinced Nickel One ' s Verpine High Coordinator to launch the asteroid ' s starfighter force , in coordination with Mandalorian starships , at the \" Dominion \" . The fighters succeeded in their suicide run , and the warship was destroyed . Description . The \" Dominion \" was a Star Dreadnought in the service of the Imperial Remnant . It was used as the flagship of the invasion force during the Remnant ' s attack on the Roche asteroid field in 41 ABY . History . The Star Dreadnought \" Dominion \" was originally in the service of Imperial warlord Blitzer Harrsk , whose forces were located in the Deep Core region of the galaxy . In the aftermath of Admiral Natasi Daala ' s unification of the Imperial Remnant , the \" Dominion \" was left abandoned at Deep 3 , one of Harrsk ' s shipyards , with the Star Dreadnought \" Megador \" . In 12 ABY , during his survey of Imperial armories in the Deep Core , Imperial officer Gilad Pellaeon stumbled upon Deep 3 and procured both Star Dreadnoughts for the Imperial Remnant ' s war against the New Republic . Confident that the New Republic did not know of the existence of the \" Dominion \" or the \" Megador \" , Pellaeon sought to use the warships to his advantage . As Imperial and New Republic forces engaged one another above the planet Orinda , the \" Dominion \" \u2014 under the command of Admiral Teren Rogriss \u2014 entered the system with six Interdictor cruisers , trapping the New Republic forces . The \" Dominion \" joined the Star Dreadnought \" Reaper \" in battling the New Republic Star Dreadnought \" Lusankya \" until the Republic forces were able to flee after creating a hole in the interdiction field . The \" Dominion \" continued to serve in the Remnant ' s navy , and in 17 ABY it saw action in the Battle of Anx Minor , a defeat that proved costly for the Remnant . The Super Star Destroyer ' s service continued for decades . In 41 ABY , at the height of the Second Galactic Civil War , the \" Dominion \" was designated as the flagship of the Remnant ' s invasion fleet that attacked the Roche asteroid field . Seeking to seize the native Verpines ' technology for use in the Remnant ' s war effort , the Imperials began an assault on the primary asteroid , Nickel One . Mandalore Boba Fett \u2014 who was aiding the Verpine in repelling the Imperials \u2014 convinced Nickel One ' s High Coordinator to throw her full complement of starfighters at the \" Dominion \" upon its arrival in a suicide run in conjunction with the initial attacks of the Mandalorian starships . The tactic proved highly successful ; the fighters destroyed the Super Star Destroyer and killed two Imperial Moffs who had been unable to avoid the warship ' s destruction . Nonetheless , the Imperials managed to capture Nickel One with what forces they had left . Commanders and crew . Though originally a part of Blitzer Harrsk ' s forces , the \" Dominion \" was taken by Gilad Pellaeon for use in the Remnant ' s war against the New Republic . At Orinda , the warship was commanded by Admiral Teren Rogriss . Decades later , during the battle for Nickel One , the Imperial commanders had not expected a strong Verpine - Mandalorian counter - offensive . When the \" Dominion \" was attacked by Nickel One ' s starfighter force , many Moffs of the Council of Moffs were present aboard the Super Star Destroyer . Two of them perished when the warship was obliterated . Behind the scenes .
